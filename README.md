# Dynamic Note Taker

## Description

This project serves as an easy to use Note Taker application. It utilizes Express.js along with node.js to dynamically create the notes on the server side. Then, the application makes fetch requests to the server side to display the notes to the user.

Any user can create notes through the deployed webpage application, the notes will be saved and persisted. When a user clicks a note, the text details will be displayed in the main note section. A user can also opt to delete a note if they're finished with it.

Deployed Application: https://dynamic-note-taker.herokuapp.com/
